- [wiki](http://ycs-wiki.xreflector.net/doku.php)
    - [[YCS]] was developed to support the various protocols that are available for the exchange of C4FM streams. The new System Fusion II [[IMRS]] (Internet-linked Multi-site Repeater System) protocol which is available for the new DR-2X YAESU-Repeater is also supported. This makes it possible to combine Repeaters and HOTSPOTS in one server.
